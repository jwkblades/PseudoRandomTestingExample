Pseudo-Random Testing
=====================

A quick example of how pseudo-random testing can be used to make unit test
cases easier to develop by leaving the majority of the work to the computer and
having simple states that can be easily checked programmatically.

Some portions of the class have been left purposely incomplete for users to
fill in if they so choose.

Yeah, they have a programming section and everything, so I figured I'd lend
some knowledge to programming broadcasts that take the form of a video
tutorial. In the broadcasts I go through what I am creating, why I am making
the decisions I am (and programming the items in a given way) as well as some
of the common pit falls that people just starting out run in to.

If you are interested in viewing a broadcast at some point, feel free to drop
